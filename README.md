# Ringer

A time management app for chronic procrastinators.

## Overview

Ringer is based on the Pomodoro Technique, but uses the idea of "forging rings" to represent the checkmarks. Each session creates a "ring" that can be attached to whichever task was completed under it.

The workflow is straightforward:

1. Create a **story** and define its main objective;
2. List every **task** that must be done in this story;
3. Start the timer to begin a Pomodoro session.

The app restricts the user in a few ways:

* You cannot start a session without having unfinished tasks;
* The timer will cooldown between sessions, to enforce short and long breaks;
* Once a session is done, you must attach your new ring to the task you worked on.
* A task will be deemed **complex** once it holds 7 rings, and must be broken down to continue work.

## Why restrict the user?

The goal of Ringer is to help people with poor self-management and self-discipline to get things done. When you have excess freedom, organization and focus can be challenging: you might not know where to begin, where your task ends, if a task you wrote is too lofty or complicated etc. Confusion in this process can easily lead to procrastination.

Ringer attempts to put users into "rails", to help them pay attention to the process. Users are expected to respect the commitment of a session, to not forget their short and long breaks, to always rethink the stories/tasks they wrote, and so on. In theory, this should assist the user in writing more manageable tasks, and to learn how to better manage their time when working.

## Feedback

Ringer is a pet project based primarily on my own experience as a procrastinator; it's something that I, myself, expect to use once it's working well. With that said, as this app grows, I'd like users to provide feedback of how their experience with it was: if it helped focus, if it restrained too much etc. The idea of restrictions sounds good on paper, but may prove to not be useful down the line for most real users.

Right now the app is still limited, but I'm hoping to add more stuff quickly over this year. Thanks for checking it out.
